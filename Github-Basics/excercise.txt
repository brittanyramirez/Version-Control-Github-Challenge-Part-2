A computer terminal is like the "engine room" of the computer.
The terminal controls your computer because it is a text based 
tool. This allows you to control it by typing the commands instead 
of having to click on icons. It's almost like having a conversation with
your computer's operating system.


There are multiple differences between Git and GitHub. If I had to choose
the main difference it would be that Git focuses on version control and code sharing
while GitHub focuses on centralized source code hosting. Git is a software meanwhile GitHub
is a servce. Another difference between the two would be how they are accessed, Git is installed locally 
on the system. Meanwhile Github is hosted on the web. These are the main differences 
that stand out to me.


Please follow the following steps if you are trying to fork your GitHub repository.
1: Open Github on your web browser and open up the repository you are trying to fork.
2: Click on the "Fork" button that is located in the top right corner.
3: Make sure the correct owner is selected. You will click under "owner" and click on 
the dropdown menu and click the correct owner for the the forked repository.
4: Click "Create fork" button. This will now create an entire copy of the repository.
5: You may also add descriptions in the "description" box which can be helpful. After all this
you can move onto cloning your forked repository.
